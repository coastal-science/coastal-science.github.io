Master's student, Janine McNeilly, has recently been awarded the Graduate Research Award for Environmental Science at Simon Fraser University. Janine's research focuses on the diet and energetic requirements of the endangered Southern Resident killer whales (SRKW). Her goal is to create a bioenergetics model for the SRKW and input various parameters for Chinook salmon and sablefish to determine if sablefish are a viable prey alternative. She has partnered with DFO to complete the field work component, which involves collecting prey and fecal samples from SRKW to determine the composition of their diet. Congratulations Janine!
