# description: "Models that identify the source of underwater sounds."
---

Our team has developed models that identify the source of underwater sounds. For example, we have a binary classification model that classifies sounds into one of two categories - the sound was made by a Killer whale or the sound was not made by a Killer whale. These models were developed with data from Fisheries and Oceans Canada, JASCO, SMRU, ... . 
 
Check out these open source models on our public [GitHub repository](https://github.com/coastal-science/HALLO-models). There you can find instructions, scripts, and configuration files required to train deep learning models at detecting and classifying vocalisations made by Killer whales.
