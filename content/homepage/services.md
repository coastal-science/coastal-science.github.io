Our project began in earnest in 20XX. Since then we've been working on multiple deliverables/projects/products/? that work towards developing a real-time forecasting system for cetaceans in the Salish Sea.

#### Call Catalogue

We can introduce the catalogue project here. Give credit to John Ford & other contributors. 
Then probably [link](/catalogue) to its location.

#### Classification Models 

We have models that provide classifications for heard sounds. For example, we have a binary classification model to determine whether a sound was an Killer Whale or not. These models were developed with data from Fisheries and Oceans Canada, JASCO, SMRU, ... . 
 
Check out the open source model's on our public [GitHub repository](https://github.com/coastal-science/HALLO-models). There you can find instructions, scripts and configuration files required to train deep learning models at detecting and classifying vocalisations made by killer whales.

#### Forecast Models

We have more models! We bring together environmental data, citizen science observations, and hydrophone data to forecast where a cetacean is going to be. This system allows us to alert ports, ship captains, and ... when a whale might be entering their path so they can take risk-reducing measures.

#### Bioacoustics Workshop

In August 2022 we hosted a bioacoustics workshop (hybrid delivery).
