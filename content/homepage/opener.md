*Here we can include some information about the project generally. This section will not show up in the header menu above.*

Humans and Algorithms Listening to Orcas explores the concept of training artificial intelligence systems to detect underwater whale vocalizations. The research goal is to develop a whale forecasting system to warn nearby ships of whale presence. This could prevent potentially fatal ship strikes for the endangered Southern Resident killer whales and other whale species that frequent the waters of the Salish Sea in the Pacific Northwest. 

To train the artificial intelligence systems, we use recordings of verified whale vocalizations from several hydrophones located around the Salish Sea. These hydrophones are operated by various partners including citizen scientists and projects like the [Orcasound project](https://www.orcasound.net/).
