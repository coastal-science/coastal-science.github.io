HALLO formed and began research efforts in 2019. Since then, we've been working on several objectives that work towards developing the real-time whale forecasting system in the Salish Sea.

#### Call Catalogue

*We can introduce the catalogue project here. Give credit to John Ford & other contributors. 
Then probably [link](/catalogue) to its location.* 

We have compiled a catalogue of the 30 unique call types made by Southern Resident killer whales. This allows our team of annotators to manually identify individual call types contained in hydrophone recordings. These data are then used to train the artificial inteligence systems to detect these calls.

#### Classification Models 

Our team has developed models that identify the source of underwater sounds. For example, we have a binary classification model that classifies sounds into one of two categories - the sound was made by a Killer whale or the sound was not made by a Killer whale. These models were developed with data from Fisheries and Oceans Canada, JASCO, SMRU, ... . 
 
Check out these open source models on our public [GitHub repository](https://github.com/coastal-science/HALLO-models). There you can find instructions, scripts, and configuration files required to train deep learning models at detecting and classifying vocalisations made by Killer whales.

#### Forecast Models

We have more models! We bring together environmental data, citizen science observations, and hydrophone data to forecast where a cetacean is going to be. This system allows us to alert ports, ship captains, and ... when a whale might be entering their path so they can take risk-reducing measures.

#### Bioacoustics Workshop

In August 2022 we hosted a bioacoustics workshop (hybrid delivery).
